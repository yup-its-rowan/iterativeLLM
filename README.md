## Diary

### Day 1
I have this idea of developing a simple LLM that I can train on my computer, with outputs similar to that of GTP-1 or GPT-2. 
There's been a boom in the capabilities of processors and graphics cards since their initial development, and I hope that more advanced training techniques would result in a similarly better model.
I hope to spend no longer than a couple hours on a training session on my desktop, but we will see how that goes. 

First thing to do is to understand the structure of LLMs, what needs to be done in order to
